# CNN-Pneumonia-Classification-on-TPU

* Context: The task is to predict if a given  x-ray image is either of a
   Pneumonia prone or a normal person. 
* This is a CNN model. 
* The problem of overfitting is faced here and is resolved by increasing the precision 
  of the classification model.
* Early stopping method is also used for better performance.
